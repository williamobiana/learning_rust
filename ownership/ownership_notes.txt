Programs need "rooms" (memory) to store data
They must check out when done (deallocate)

Stack vs Heap

Stack:
Variables live on the STACK, can store small amounts of memory, and is automatically cleaned up when function ends
let x = 5;  // Stored on stack
let y = x;  // COPY value (5 is small)

Heap:
Boxes live on the HEAP, can store large amounts of memory, and is manually cleaned up when function ends
let a = Box::new([0; 1_000_000]);  // Big array on heap
let b = a;  // MOVE pointer, not copy data


The Ownership Rules:
Rule 1: Each value has ONE owner
    let s1 = String::from("hello");  // s1 owns "hello"
    let s2 = s1;                     // Ownership MOVES to s2
    // println!("{}", s1);           // ERROR! s1 lost ownership

Rule 2: When owner goes out of scope, value is dropped
    {
        let s = String::from("hello");  // Created
        // do stuff
    }        

Cloning vs Moving:
Moving (default):
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;            // MOVES ownership
    // s1 is now invalid

Cloning (explicit copy):
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1.clone();    // COPIES the data
    // Both s1 and s2 are valid
