variables are immutable by default.

add library packages[crates] to the dependencies section of Cargo.toml to use them in your code.
cargo doc --open        = to see all the documentations, commands and functions of all the library/crate and project
we can overwrite variable with the same name. Example overwriting a `mut var` with an immutable `var` based on the hieracy of the logic (Top-down)

.expect = is an error handler, but can cause the code to panic and end when it encounters an error.
_ = ignore. This is typically used when you want to ignore errors during error_handling that can stop the code from running.
