let variable: <data_type> = ... (Assigning a data type to a variable)
Most times Rust can guess the data type, unless you explicitly want to give it a type

SINGLE VALUE DATA TYPE (Scalar)

* integers (whole numbers) //bits: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128
    * i32 (signed: can have + or - sign)
    * u32 (unsigned: defaults to only + sign)
    * isize/usize (sign that match your computer architecture) CONCEPT UNCLEAR

    interger overflow: CONCEPT UNCLEAR

* floating number (decimals) //bits: f32, f64
    *f64 is default

* booleans (true/false)
    * commonly used with conditions (if statements)

* characters (unicode characters) //example: emojis
    * single quotes '' for characters
    * double quotes "" for strings

COMPOUND DATA TYPE

* tuple (immutable list of diffrent values types) //uses ()
    * let person = ("john", 35, true);
    * let person: (&str, i32, bool) = ("john", 35, true);

    There are 2 ways to call the value from the tuple. //since the person has values already, we can print name, age, employed and get values from person
    1. Unpacking
        let (name, age, employed) = person; 
    2. using .index 
        let name        = person.0;
        let age         = person.1;
        let employed    = person.2;

    tuple can be mutable by adding mut when creating the variable
        let mut scores = (1, 2, 3);
        scores.0 = 5;
        scores.1 += 8; //using operations to modify the previous values

    tuple can also be empty
        let nothing = (); //to return an empty list

* list/array (mutable list of same value types) // uses []
    * simple array
        let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    * array with type and size
        let numbers: [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5]; //[type; size]

    * array with some values and size
        let zeros = [0; 5]; // adding ; after the value will define the size as [0,0,0,0,0] 

    * array with strings
        let months = ["jan", "feb", "mar"];

    Calling values from the array
    1. Using index
        let first = numbers[0];
        let second = numbers[1];
        let thrid = numbers[2];
...
