CONSTANTS (const) vs IMMUTABLE VARIABLES
Constants & immutable variables are similar since the values assigned cannot be changed.
Examples:
let x = 5
const DEV_ENV = "dev"


VARIABLES SHADOWING 
Immutable variables can be overshadowed/overwritten (if you create 2 variables with the same name, the 2nd will overwrite the 1st)
Constants cannot be overshadowed
    Example 1:
    let x = 5
    let x = 6 (6 will overwrite 5)

using mut we can also overwrite the variable, without creating a new 1
    Example 2:
    let mut x = 5
    x = 6
    However, If the 2 variables are of diffrent types, it will throw an error

In this case it is better to create 2 variables (Example 1)


VARIABLES EXECUTION
Immutable variables are executed in run-time (good for function variables)
Constants are executed in compile (good for ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES and Global Variables)
